# MySQL Databases

This contains all the CSCI6622 databases.

To submit your assignment, add a file called `my_assignment.sql` to this repository.

If the database you need to use is the Northwind database, then your SQL file should start with

`use northwind;`

Check the 'Actions' tab for information about why this is failing:
